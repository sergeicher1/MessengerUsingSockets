# 🎙️ Real-Time Two-User Chat Application

Welcome to the **Real-Time Two-User Chat Application**! 🚀 This project demonstrates a simple server-client model where two users can engage in a real-time text-based chat through socket communication. Designed with Python's `socket` and `threading` modules, this project is perfect for beginners looking to explore networking concepts.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Bi-Directional Messaging**: Real-time communication between two clients.  
- **Threaded Connections**: Ensures seamless interaction by handling each client in a separate thread.  
- **Interactive Color-Coded UI**: Messages are styled with ANSI escape codes for enhanced readability:
  - 🟢 **You**: Green text.
  - 🟠 **Opponent**: Orange text.
  - 🔴 **Prompt**: Red text.  
- **Graceful Exit**: Clients can exit the chat with the `exit` command, ensuring clean disconnection.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Server
The server listens for connections from two clients and facilitates communication between them.  
- Accepts two clients.  
- Relays messages from one client to the other.  
- Handles client disconnections gracefully.  

### Client
Each client connects to the server and participates in a chat.  
- Sends messages to the opponent via the server.  
- Displays messages in a colorful and user-friendly interface.

## 📂 File Structure

- **`server.py`**: Contains the server implementation to handle connections and message forwarding.  
- **`client.py`**: Represents the client-side code for users to join the chat.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.  
- Basic understanding of networking and Python.  

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/two-user-chat.git
   cd two-user-chat
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   No external libraries are required. This project uses Python's standard library.  

### Running the Project

1. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   The server listens on `127.0.0.1:6000`.  

2. **Start Clients**:
   Open two separate terminals and run:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```
   Each client connects to the server and joins the chat.  

3. **Chat Away**:
   - Type your messages and press `Enter` to send.
   - Type `exit` to leave the chat.
